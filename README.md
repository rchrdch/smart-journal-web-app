# smart-journal-web-app

As a personal project, I developed a Flask web application (which is now deployed on Heroku) that functions as a personal journal to keep track of emotions and allow for a comprehensive, retrospective overview. This app lets users log into their Google account using OAuth and type in their daily thoughts, which is then sent to IBM’s Natural Language Understanding API to analyze sentiment and emotion. This data is then stored in MongoDB’s database for retrieving journal entries.
